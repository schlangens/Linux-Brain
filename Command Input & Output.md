There are 2 ways to get data into a command and 2 ways to get data out.

Standard Input, Standard Output and Standard Error are "Standard Data Streams"

Data streams can be redirected from their default locations to wherever you wish.

You can redirect the standard output of one command to the standard input of another in a process known as "piping"
