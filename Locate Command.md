Depending on what distribution you are running the `locate` command may not come pre-installed. Ubuntu 20.04 appears to have this issue, for example, but Ubuntu 18.04 does not.

If you find you are having issues, try installing the `locate`Â  and `mlocate` packages from your repositories.

`sudo apt install locate`

`sudo apt install mlocate`

## Build current DB

`sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist`

## Update the DB

`sudo updatedb`

## Get info on current DB after building

`locate -s`

```

Scotts-MacBook-Pro:~ sschlangen$ locate -S

## Bckup db to desktop of current user

## Check to see if .conf exist
