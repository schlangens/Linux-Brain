## Introduction to RHEL

#### Using the Console

### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1. Identify the major components of the RHEL console.
2. Differentiate between the various consoles available in RHEL and which situations one console is preferable to another.

### What is the difference between a console and a shell?

> All right, now a lot of people use these terms interchangeably treated the same. The console is actually the tool we use to view a shell. So, the shell is the command line interpreter.
> So, when we typed commands into the system, the shells was receiving those commands and then turning them into something that the kernel understands.
> The kernel will do something with it, right, return some data back to us and the shell will show us that data

`ctrl alt{F1..F6}`
Each function key is tied to different consoles

> Most people are not going to use the text based consoles we just discussed unless they're troubleshooting.
> Most people are going to log into the Window manager and fire up whatever the default terminal is. Well, RHEL uses the _Gnome Window manager by default_, so does Ubuntu, so does debian, so CentOS, so does. Fedora, like most of them use Gnome as the default window manager, and that means that if you just hit your super key, the one that may have a Windows logo on it or whatever. And type in term you'll find a little terminal and when you launch that terminal, it will take you into what is actually the gnome terminal.
