### Objectives:

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1. Install the Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT)
2. Configure the destinations for ABRT reports.
3. Enable automatic reporting of bugs to Red Hat.
4. View and interpret the reports generated by the ABRT.

### To install

`sudo dnf install abrt`
`sudo systemctl enable --now abrtd.service`

- By default ABRT is acting as a collector so you have it

`/etc/libreport` - Contains configuration files

### To send these along

`abrt-cli`

`sudo dnf install abrt-tui -y`
`sudo abrt-auto-reporting enabled`

### To see crashes - they would have ID

`sudo abrt-cli list`

## To see more information via CLI

`sudo abrt-cli info -d <id number tied to event> `

## To send along

`sudo abrt-cli report <1>`

### Restart ABRT

`sudo systemctl restart abrtd`

### Generate a fake crash

`sleep 100 &`
