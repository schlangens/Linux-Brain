To block an IP or port using IP Tables, you can create a firewall shell script with the following steps:

1. Add a rule to drop all incoming traffic from a specific IP address:

```
iptables -A INPUT -s <ip_address> -j DROP
```

Replace `<ip_address>` with the IP address you want to block.

2. Add a rule to drop all incoming traffic on a specific port:

```
iptables -A INPUT -p <protocol> --dport <port_number> -j DROP
```

Replace `<protocol>` with the protocol (e.g., TCP or UDP) you want to block, and `<port_number>` with the port number you want to block.

3. To block outgoing traffic to a specific IP address or port, use the following commands:

```
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <ip_address> -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -p <protocol> --dport <port_number> -j DROP
```

Replace `<ip_address>` with the IP address you want to block and `<protocol>` and `<port_number>` with the protocol and port number you want to block.

4. Save your IP Tables rules with the following command:

```
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

This will save your rules to the file `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`, which will be loaded at startup.

That's it! You can customize these commands to suit your specific needs and run the script on your firewall to block IP addresses or ports.
